## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Blockers)
1. **Security vulnerability:** Could expose customer data
   - Mitigation: Complete security checklist, penetration testing
2. **Performance issues:** Batch operations fail under load
   - Mitigation: Load testing, optimization, database tuning
3. **QuickBooks integration errors:** Failed syncs cause data inconsistency
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing, error handling, retry logic

### Medium Risk (Degraded Experience)
1. **Slow page loads:** Users abandon platform
   - Mitigation: Performance optimization, caching, CDN
2. **Insufficient monitoring:** Issues go undetected
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. **Poor documentation:** Users struggle with onboarding
   - Mitigation: User guides, videos, in-app help

### Low Risk (Minor Issues)
1. **UI inconsistencies:** Confusing but not blocking
   - Mitigation: UI/UX review, user testing
2. **Missing features:** Users request additional functionality
   - Mitigation: Feature roadmap, regular updates
