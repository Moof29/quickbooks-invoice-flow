# Next Phase: Module Review & Optimization

**Priority**: After status workflow fix is complete

## üìã Comprehensive Module Review Plan

### Objectives
1. **Correctness** - All buttons/actions work as intended
2. **Performance** - Handle high volume of orders efficiently
3. **Reliability** - Robust error handling, no data loss
4. **Usability** - Intuitive UI/UX to prevent user mistakes

## üîç Sales Order Module Review

### Actions to Review
- [ ] Create Order (manual)
- [ ] Generate Orders from Templates
- [ ] Confirm Order (draft ‚Üí confirmed)
- [ ] Mark as Delivered (confirmed ‚Üí delivered)
- [ ] Edit Order

### Questions to Answer
1. Can users accidentally create duplicate orders?
2. Are there proper confirmations for destructive actions?
3. Can orders be edited after confirmation? (Should they be?)
4. What happens if template generation fails partway?
5. Are bulk actions atomic (all or nothing)?
6. Can users filter to see "today's orders" easily?
7. Is the status progression clear and intuitive?
8. Are loading states shown for slow operations?

## ‚ö° Performance & Scalability

### High Volume Scenarios to Test
- [ ] 100+ orders generated from templates at once
- [ ] 1000+ orders in the list view
- [ ] Bulk operations on 50+ orders
- [ ] Filtering/searching with large datasets
- [ ] Dashboard with heavy queries

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Page load time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Search/filter results < 1 second
- [ ] Bulk operations show progress indicators
- [ ] Pagination for large lists
- [ ] Debounced search inputs
- [ ] Efficient database queries (no N+1 queries)
- [ ] Proper indexes on frequently queried columns

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Reliability & Error Handling

### Robustness Checks
- [ ] Network failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates with rollback on error
- [ ] Transaction safety (orders + line items created atomically)
- [ ] Proper error messages (user-friendly, actionable)
- [ ] No silent failures
- [ ] Retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Concurrent edit protection
- [ ] Data validation on both client and server

---

## üé® UI/UX & Intuitiveness

### User Error Prevention
- [ ] Confirm before deleting/voiding
- [ ] Disabled states for invalid actions
- [ ] Clear status indicators
- [ ] Helpful tooltips for complex actions
- [ ] Undo capability where possible
- [ ] Clear success/error feedback
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Mobile-friendly touch targets

### Intuitive Design
- [ ] Status badges use consistent colors
- [ ] Action buttons grouped logically
- [ ] Most common actions easily accessible
- [ ] Rare/dangerous actions require extra steps
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Generate orders from templates
2. Customer confirms draft orders
3. Fulfill and mark as delivered
4. Record payments
5. Verify all status transitions work

### Error Scenarios
1. What if template has no line items?
2. What if customer is inactive?
3. What if duplicate order is attempted?
4. What if payment amount doesn't match invoice?
5. What if network fails during bulk operation?

### Edge Cases
1. Orders with $0 total
2. Orders with is_no_order flag
3. Orders without delivery date
4. Very large orders (100+ line items)
5. Orders created in the past

## üìù Notes

This review will be conducted AFTER the status workflow fix is applied and verified.

Focus areas:
1. **Correctness** - Does it work?
2. **Performance** - Does it scale?
3. **Reliability** - Does it handle errors?
4. **Usability** - Is it intuitive?

Expected timeline: Thorough review will take 2-3 hours with Lovable.
