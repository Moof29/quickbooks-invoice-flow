# Midday Inspiration & Ideas for Batchly

**Source:** https://github.com/midday-ai/midday (12.8k stars, AGPL-3.0 license)

**What is Midday?** Business management platform for freelancers and solo entrepreneurs - consolidates time tracking, invoicing, file storage, and financial management into one platform.

---

## TL;DR: Key Takeaways for Batchly

**What to adopt:**
1. ✅ Monorepo structure with shared packages (you're already close with Supabase)
2. ✅ AI-powered document matching ("Magic Inbox" concept)
3. ✅ Real-time collaborative invoicing
4. ✅ Multi-platform strategy (web + mobile app later)
5. ✅ Comprehensive email/notification system
6. ✅ File vault for storing contracts, POs, agreements

**What you do BETTER than Midday:**
1. ✅ QuickBooks integration (they don't have it!)
2. ✅ B2B order management (they're solo/freelancer focused)
3. ✅ Batch operations (they don't mention bulk processing)
4. ✅ Customer templates with day-of-week rules (unique to Batchly)

**Your competitive advantage:** You're building the **B2B wholesale/distribution** version of Midday with deeper accounting integration.

### 4. Ideas to Steal from Midday

#### Idea 1: File Vault / Document Management ✅

**What Midday Has:**
- Secure file storage for contracts, agreements, invoices
- Organized by category/project
- Easy retrieval for tax time

**How Batchly Could Implement:**
```typescript
// Add to Batchly
packages/documents/
  ├── upload.ts          # Upload PDFs, images, contracts
  ├── storage.ts         # Supabase Storage integration
  └── categories.ts      # Organize by type (PO, contract, receipt)

Database tables:
CREATE TABLE document_vault (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL,
  customer_id UUID,           -- Optional: link to customer
  invoice_id UUID,            -- Optional: link to invoice
  order_id UUID,              -- Optional: link to order
  document_type TEXT,         -- 'purchase_order', 'contract', 'receipt', 'other'
  file_name TEXT,
  file_url TEXT,              -- Supabase Storage URL
  file_size BIGINT,
  mime_type TEXT,
  uploaded_by UUID,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  tags TEXT[]                 -- Search tags
);
```

**Use Cases for Batchly:**
- Store customer purchase orders (POs)
- Store signed contracts
- Store delivery receipts/proofs
- Store vendor invoices (expenses)
- Attach documents to invoices/orders

**UI:**
```tsx
// On invoice detail page
<Tabs>
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="details">Details</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="documents">Documents (3)</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="documents">
    <DocumentVault invoiceId={invoice.id} />
    <UploadButton onUpload={handleUpload} />
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (nice to have after core features)

---

#### Idea 2: Magic Inbox (AI Document Matching) ✅

**What Midday Has:**
- AI automatically matches incoming invoices/receipts to bank transactions
- Categorizes expenses automatically
- Saves time on bookkeeping

**How Batchly Could Implement:**
```typescript
// Email ingestion
packages/inbox/
  ├── email-parser.ts    # Parse emails from customers (POs, payment confirmations)
  ├── ai-matcher.ts      # Match email to customer/order
  └── auto-create.ts     # Auto-create orders from recurring customer emails

Features:
1. Customer emails PO to orders@yourbatchly.com
2. AI extracts: Customer name, items, quantities, delivery date
3. Auto-match to customer in Batchly
4. Create draft order automatically
5. Notify you: "New order from ABC Corp (review required)"
6. You review, adjust, approve

AI Providers:
- OpenAI GPT-4 (text extraction)
- Gemini (document understanding)
- Anthropic Claude (structured data extraction)
```

**Use Cases for Batchly:**
- Auto-create orders from customer PO emails
- Match payment confirmations to invoices
- Extract delivery dates from customer communications
- Categorize incoming documents

**Priority:** HIGH (huge time saver, differentiator)

---

#### Idea 3: Real-Time Collaborative Invoicing ✅

**What Midday Has:**
- Multiple users can edit invoice simultaneously
- See other users' cursors/changes live
- Like Google Docs for invoices

**How Batchly Could Implement:**
```typescript
// Supabase Realtime for live collaboration
packages/collaboration/
  ├── presence.ts        # Track who's viewing/editing
  ├── cursors.ts         # Show user cursors
  └── sync.ts            # Real-time field updates

Features:
1. Multiple team members can edit order/invoice
2. See who's viewing (avatars at top)
3. See live updates as others type
4. Conflict resolution (last write wins)
5. Lock editing when order approved (prevent conflicts)

Database:
CREATE TABLE user_presence (
  user_id UUID,
  entity_type TEXT,       -- 'order', 'invoice'
  entity_id UUID,
  last_seen_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, entity_type, entity_id)
);
```

**Use Cases for Batchly:**
- Manager reviews order while you're creating it
- Two users work on large order together
- Customer service helps while you're invoicing

**Priority:** LOW (nice to have, not critical for solo/small team)

---

#### Idea 4: Notification System ✅

**What Midday Has:**
- `@midday/notifications` package
- Email, push, in-app notifications
- Unified notification preferences

**How Batchly Could Implement:**
```typescript
packages/notifications/
  ├── email.ts           # Email via Resend
  ├── in-app.ts          # Toast notifications
  └── preferences.ts     # User notification settings

Notification Types:
1. Order notifications:
   - Order approved → Notify creator
   - Large order created → Notify manager
   - Order past due date → Notify customer service

2. Invoice notifications:
   - Invoice created → Notify customer via email
   - Invoice paid → Notify sales rep
   - Invoice overdue → Notify accounting

3. Sync notifications:
   - QB sync failed → Notify admin
   - Large batch complete → Notify user
   - Payment status updated → Notify sales

4. System notifications:
   - New team member joined → Notify admin
   - Plan upgrade needed → Notify billing owner
```

**Database:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_preferences (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email_order_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  email_invoice_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  email_sync_failed BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  in_app_all BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT,
  message TEXT,
  entity_type TEXT,
  entity_id UUID,
  read_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**UI:**
```tsx
// Header with notification bell
<NotificationBell unreadCount={5} />

// Notification dropdown
<NotificationList>
  <NotificationItem
    title="Order #123 approved"
    message="John approved your order for ABC Corp"
    time="2 minutes ago"
    onClick={() => navigate(`/orders/123`)}
  />
</NotificationList>
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (improves UX, not critical for internal launch)

---

#### Idea 5: AI Insights & Analytics ✅

**What Midday Has:**
- AI analyzes spending patterns
- Provides insights: "You're spending 20% more on X this month"
- Predictive analytics

**How Batchly Could Implement:**
```typescript
packages/ai-insights/
  ├── patterns.ts        # Detect trends in order data
  ├── recommendations.ts # Suggest optimizations
  └── forecasting.ts     # Predict future orders

AI Insights for Batchly:
1. Customer insights:
   - "ABC Corp orders 10% more on Mondays - adjust template?"
   - "Customer XYZ hasn't ordered in 14 days (usually weekly)"
   - "Top 5 customers by revenue this month"

2. Inventory insights:
   - "Item 'Tomatoes' ordered 30% more this week"
   - "Running low on popular items - consider stocking up"
   - "Seasonal trend detected: Demand up 40% in summer"

3. Revenue insights:
   - "Revenue up 15% vs. last month"
   - "Average order value increased to $320"
   - "Projected revenue for next month: $45K (based on patterns)"

4. Operational insights:
   - "You're creating invoices 2 hours faster with Batchly"
   - "Batch operations saved you 8 hours this week"
   - "QuickBooks sync success rate: 99.2%"
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Use OpenAI for natural language insights
async function generateInsights(organizationId: string) {
  const orders = await getRecentOrders(organizationId, 30); // Last 30 days
  const previousOrders = await getRecentOrders(organizationId, 60, 30); // Previous 30 days

  const prompt = `
    Analyze these order patterns and provide 3-5 actionable insights:

    Current period (last 30 days):
    - Total orders: ${orders.length}
    - Total revenue: $${orders.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o.total, 0)}
    - Top customers: ${topCustomers}

    Previous period:
    - Total orders: ${previousOrders.length}
    - Total revenue: $${previousOrders.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o.total, 0)}

    Provide insights in this format:
    1. [Trend] - [Recommendation]
    2. ...
  `;

  const insights = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
  });

  return insights.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

**UI:**
```tsx
// Dashboard widget
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>AI Insights</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <InsightsList>
      <Insight
        icon={<TrendingUp />}
        text="Revenue up 15% vs. last month - great work!"
        action="View details"
      />
      <Insight
        icon={<AlertTriangle />}
        text="ABC Corp hasn't ordered in 14 days (usually weekly)"
        action="Send reminder"
      />
    </InsightsList>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

**Priority:** LOW (cool feature, not critical for launch)

---

#### Idea 6: Mobile App Strategy ✅

**What Midday Has:**
- Expo (React Native) mobile app
- Shared codebase with web via monorepo packages
- Full feature parity on mobile

**How Batchly Could Implement:**
```
Timeline:
1. Internal launch (web only) - Now
2. Prove value internally (1-3 months)
3. Expand to external customers (web only) - Month 3-6
4. Build mobile app (if customer demand) - Month 6-12

Mobile Use Cases for Batchly:
- Review/approve orders on the go
- Check invoice status from phone
- Receive push notifications for approvals
- Quick order creation (voice input?)
- Barcode scanning for items (future)

Tech Stack:
- Expo (React Native) - same as Midday
- Share packages: @batchly/ui, @batchly/db, @batchly/qbo
- Supabase client works on mobile
- React Query works on mobile
- 80% code reuse from web app
```

**Priority:** VERY LOW (future, after product-market fit on web)

---

### 5. Architecture Lessons from Midday

#### Lesson 1: Monorepo is Powerful for Multi-Platform

**Midday's approach:**
```
apps/
  ├── web/         (Next.js)
  ├── mobile/      (Expo)
  ├── desktop/     (Tauri)
  └── api/         (tRPC on Fly.io)

packages/
  └── [21 shared packages]

Result: Same business logic across all platforms
```

**How Batchly Could Evolve:**
```
Phase 1 (Now): Single app
  - All code in one place
  - Fast iteration

Phase 2 (After PMF): Monorepo
  - Extract common logic to packages
  - Prepare for mobile/API

Phase 3 (Scale): Multi-platform
  - Add mobile app
  - Add public API
  - Add desktop app (if needed)
```

**When to adopt:** Not now. After you have 50+ customers and demand for mobile.

---

#### Lesson 2: Background Jobs Are Critical

**Midday uses:**
- Trigger.dev for background jobs
- Handles: Email sending, data imports, AI processing, scheduled tasks

**Batchly currently uses:**
- Supabase Edge Functions (synchronous)
- pg_cron (scheduled tasks)

**Recommendation:**
- Your current approach is fine for internal launch
- Consider Trigger.dev or Inngest later for:
  - Long-running QB sync jobs
  - Scheduled order generation
  - Email campaigns
  - Data migrations

**Priority:** LOW (current solution works, upgrade later)

---

#### Lesson 3: Email is a Product Feature

**Midday has dedicated `@midday/email` package:**
- Transactional emails (order confirmations, invoice delivery)
- Notification emails (payment reminders, overdue invoices)
- Marketing emails (product updates, tips)

**Batchly should add:**
```
packages/email/
  ├── templates/
  │   ├── order-confirmation.tsx    # React Email template
  │   ├── invoice-delivery.tsx
  │   ├── payment-reminder.tsx
  │   └── portal-invitation.tsx
  ├── send.ts                       # Resend integration
  └── schedule.ts                   # Scheduled emails

Email Provider: Resend (same as Midday uses)
- 100 emails/day free
- Simple API
- React Email templates (type-safe)
```

**Use Cases:**
1. **Order confirmations** - Send to customer when order approved
2. **Invoice delivery** - Email invoice PDF to customer
3. **Payment reminders** - Automated reminders for overdue invoices
4. **Portal invitations** - Invite customers to portal
5. **Team notifications** - Notify team of important events

**Priority:** MEDIUM (important for customer-facing features)

---

### 6. What Batchly Does BETTER Than Midday

**Your Unique Strengths:**

#### 1. QuickBooks Integration ✅
- **Midday:** No accounting integration mentioned
- **Batchly:** Deep QB sync (invoices, customers, items, payments)
- **Advantage:** You eliminate dual entry (Midday doesn't)

#### 2. B2B Order Management ✅
- **Midday:** No order management (solo freelancer focus)
- **Batchly:** Sales orders, templates, batch operations
- **Advantage:** You handle complex B2B workflows

#### 3. Batch Operations ✅
- **Midday:** One-at-a-time operations
- **Batchly:** Bulk order generation, bulk invoicing, sync 500+ at once
- **Advantage:** You save hours per day for distributors

#### 4. Customer Templates with Day-of-Week Rules ✅
- **Midday:** Not applicable (solo freelancer use case)
- **Batchly:** Automated recurring orders with day-specific quantities
- **Advantage:** Unique feature, huge time saver

#### 5. Customer Portal ✅
- **Midday:** Not mentioned
- **Batchly:** Self-service portal for customers to view orders/invoices
- **Advantage:** Reduces support burden

**Key Insight:** Midday is a horizontal product (broad but shallow). Batchly is a vertical product (deep in B2B distribution). Stay focused on your niche!

## Code to Steal from Midday

**1. Package Structure (Future)**
```bash
# When you're ready for monorepo
npm install -g turbo
turbo init

# Or use Bun like Midday
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
bun init
```

**2. Email Templates**
```bash
# Install React Email (same as Midday uses)
npm install react-email @react-email/components
npm install resend

# Create email templates
mkdir -p packages/email/templates
```

**3. Document Storage**
```typescript
// Supabase Storage for document vault
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('documents')
  .upload(`${organizationId}/${fileName}`, file);
```

**4. AI Integration**
```bash
# Install AI SDKs (same as Midday)
npm install openai @anthropic-ai/sdk @google/generative-ai
```

---

## Midday's Open Source Model (Inspiration)

**License:** AGPL-3.0
- Free for non-commercial use
- Commercial license available (contact for pricing)
- Allows them to build community while monetizing

**Community:**
- 12.8k GitHub stars
- 1.2k forks
- 28 contributors
- Active development (3,536 commits)

**Could Batchly Go Open Source?**

**Pros:**
- Build community and credibility
- Get free contributions (features, bug fixes)
- Faster development via community
- Marketing via GitHub stars

**Cons:**
- Competitors can fork your code
- Need to maintain community (time investment)
- Dual licensing complexity

**Recommendation:** Stay closed source for now. After you have 100+ paying customers and proven business model, consider open-sourcing with dual license (like Midday).

---

## Summary: What to Do Now

### ✅ DO (Learn from Midday)
1. Use their tech stack validation (Supabase + Shadcn is proven)
2. Plan for email notifications (high ROI)
3. Add document vault (customer POs, contracts)
4. Consider AI insights later (differentiation)
5. Keep mobile app in mind (but not now)

### ❌ DON'T (Stay Focused)
1. Don't refactor to monorepo yet (premature)
2. Don't build mobile app yet (no demand)
3. Don't add time tracking (not your use case)
4. Don't build desktop app (web is fine)
5. Don't copy everything (stay focused on B2B distribution)

### 🎯 YOUR UNIQUE VALUE
You're building what Midday DOESN'T have:
- QuickBooks integration (they lack this!)
- B2B order management
- Batch operations
- Customer templates with day-of-week rules
- Wholesale distributor workflows

**Stay focused on your niche. You're building something they can't.**

---

## Bottom Line

**Midday is a great validation of your tech choices** (Supabase, Shadcn, React, TypeScript). They've proven this stack works at scale (12.8k stars, many users).

**But Midday is NOT your competitor.** They're targeting freelancers/solopreneurs. You're targeting B2B distributors.

**Steal their best ideas:**
- Email notification system
- Document vault
- AI insights (later)
- Monorepo structure (when ready)

**But stay focused on YOUR unique value:**
- QuickBooks integration (they don't have!)
- Order management (they don't need!)
- Batch operations (they don't do!)
- B2B workflows (their focus is solo!)

**You're building "Midday for Wholesale Distributors" - that's a great position!** 🚀

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete QB sync (Phase 1) - Week 1-2
2. Launch internally - Week 3
3. Add email notifications - Month 1
