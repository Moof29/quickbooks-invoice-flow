# Batchly - Internal Launch Plan (Lean & Fast)

**Target:** Deploy for internal use in your business ASAP
**Timeline:** 3-5 days to production
**Philosophy:** Launch fast, iterate based on real usage, then expand to others

---

## Executive Summary

This is a **radically simplified** launch plan focused on getting Batchly working for your business as quickly as possible. We'll skip everything related to external customers, multi-tenancy concerns, and polish. Focus: **core functionality + basic safety**.

**Key Differences from Full Production:**
- ❌ Skip: Payment processing, customer onboarding, extensive documentation
- ❌ Skip: Multi-tenant security testing (only your org exists)
- ❌ Skip: Legal docs (internal use)
- ❌ Skip: Support systems, marketing, external user flows
- ✅ Keep: Core order/invoice workflow, QuickBooks sync, data backups
- ✅ Keep: Basic monitoring (catch critical errors)
- ✅ Keep: Performance for your scale (estimate your order volume)

## QuickBooks Sync Status & Expectations

### What Works Now ✅
- **OAuth Connection** (100%) - You can connect to QuickBooks
- **Customer Sync TO QB** (70%) - Customers sync from Batchly → QuickBooks
- **Item Sync FROM QB** (80%) - Items pull from QuickBooks → Batchly
- **Database Infrastructure** (90%) - All tables and security in place

### What's Missing ⚠️
- **Invoice Sync TO QB** (0%) - CRITICAL - Not implemented yet
- **Payment Sync FROM QB** (0%) - CRITICAL - Not implemented yet
- **Automatic Sync Processing** (0%) - No background worker yet
- **Scheduled Syncs** (0%) - No daily/weekly automation

### Impact on Your Internal Launch

**Can you launch without complete QB sync?** YES, with caveats:

**Option 1: Launch WITHOUT full QB sync (Faster)**
```
Timeline: 1-5 days
Process:
  1. Use Batchly for orders and invoices
  2. Manually create invoices in QuickBooks (old way)
  3. Track dual entry pain points
  4. Build QB sync in parallel (2-3 weeks)
  5. Switch to automatic sync when ready

Pros: Launch immediately, test Batchly workflows
Cons: Still doing dual entry (defeats main purpose)
```

**Option 2: Wait for Invoice Sync (Recommended)**
```
Timeline: 1-2 weeks + internal launch
Process:
  1. Complete Phase 1 of QBO_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md (1 week)
     - Invoice sync to QB (2-3 days)
     - Sync queue processor (1-2 days)
     - Payment sync from QB (1-2 days)
  2. Test with sample data (2-3 days)
  3. Launch internally with automatic sync
  4. Never touch QuickBooks for operations

Pros: Full automation from day 1, maximum time savings
Cons: 1-2 week delay before launch
```

### Our Recommendation

**For maximum value: Option 2 (wait 1-2 weeks)**

**Why:**
- The whole point is to NOT use QuickBooks for operations
- Invoice sync is the #1 time-saver (2-3 hours/day)
- 1-2 weeks to build is worth it vs. months of dual entry
- You can test Batchly in dev environment while building sync

**See detailed implementation plan:**
- **[QBO_SYNC_STRATEGY.md](./QBO_SYNC_STRATEGY.md)** - Complete sync strategy (one-way flows, never touch QB for operations)
- **[QBO_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](./QBO_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)** - Exact tasks, timeline, code examples

## Risk Management (Lean Version)

### What Could Go Wrong?

**Risk 1: Data Loss**
- **Mitigation:** Supabase auto-backups + weekly manual CSV exports
- **Recovery:** Restore from backup (< 4 hours)

**Risk 2: QuickBooks Sync Fails**
- **Mitigation:** Test sync with small batch first
- **Recovery:** Manual entry in QuickBooks (temporary), fix sync issue

**Risk 3: Batch Invoice Creation Fails**
- **Mitigation:** Test with your realistic volume before going live
- **Recovery:** Create invoices manually one-by-one (slower but works)

**Risk 4: System Down**
- **Mitigation:** Uptime monitoring alerts you immediately
- **Recovery:** Temporary: Use spreadsheet for orders, enter in Batchly later

### Critical Data to Backup Manually:
- Customer list (weekly CSV export)
- Item catalog (weekly CSV export)
- Orders and invoices (weekly CSV export)

**Store in:** Google Drive, Dropbox, or email to yourself

## FAQ for Internal Launch

**Q: Do we need Terms of Service or Privacy Policy?**
A: No, not for internal use. Add them before offering to external customers.

**Q: What if we find a critical bug?**
A: Fallback to your old process (spreadsheets?) while you fix it. That's why internal testing is smart!

**Q: Should we use production QuickBooks or sandbox?**
A: Production is fine for internal use. Just test with small batch first (5-10 orders).

**Q: What if we don't use QuickBooks?**
A: That's fine! You can use Batchly standalone. Just won't have sync feature.

**Q: How do we add new features?**
A: Keep a backlog, prioritize based on real pain points, and develop in sprints.

**Q: What about mobile app?**
A: The web app is mobile-responsive. Use on phone/tablet browser for now. Native app only if absolutely needed.
