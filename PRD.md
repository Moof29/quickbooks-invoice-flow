## Product Overview

### What is Batchly?

Batchly is a modern, cloud-based ERP system that streamlines the order-to-cash cycle for B2B distributors. It replaces manual order entry and spreadsheet-based workflows with automated processes that scale from 10 to 1000+ orders per day.

### Integration Architecture

**QuickBooks Online Integration:**
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow
- Supabase Edge Functions for API calls
- Token storage: Encrypted in `qbo_connections` table
- Token refresh: Automatic before expiry
- Sync operations: Push invoices, pull customers/items
- Error handling: Retry logic with exponential backoff

- `qbo-oauth-initiate` - Start OAuth flow
- `qbo-oauth-callback` - Handle OAuth callback
- `qbo-sync-customers` - Sync customer data
- `qbo-sync-items` - Sync item catalog
- `qbo-sync-invoices` - Push invoices to QBO
- `generate-daily-orders` - Automated order generation

- Idempotent (safe to retry)

**Query Optimization:**
- Select specific columns (avoid SELECT *)
- Pagination for large lists (100 items per page)
- Indexes on foreign keys and commonly filtered columns
- Materialized views for complex reports (future)

**Caching:**
- React Query: 5-minute stale time for static data (items, customers)
- React Query: 30-second stale time for dynamic data (orders, invoices)
- Aggressive prefetching on navigation

**Real-time Updates:**
- Supabase subscriptions for live data
- Automatic UI updates when data changes
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Known Limitations & Constraints

### Technical Constraints
1. **Batch Size:** Recommended max 500 orders per batch (performance degrades beyond this)
2. **QuickBooks Rate Limits:** 500 requests/minute - sync large datasets slowly
3. **Edge Function Timeout:** 6-minute max execution time
4. **File Upload Size:** 50MB max per file
5. **Real-time Subscriptions:** Max 100 concurrent connections per organization

### Business Constraints
1. **Order Uniqueness:** One order per customer per delivery date
2. **Invoice Immutability:** Invoices cannot be edited after creation (must cancel and recreate)
3. **Approved Orders:** Cannot edit after approval (workflow enforcement)
4. **Organization Isolation:** No cross-organization data sharing or visibility
5. **Customer Portal:** Read-only access (no order creation/editing)

### Known Issues & Workarounds
1. **Issue:** Very large organizations (1000+ customers) may experience slow daily generation
   - **Workaround:** Generate in batches by customer segment
   - **Future Fix:** Implement parallel processing in multiple Edge Functions

2. **Issue:** QuickBooks token refresh occasionally fails
   - **Workaround:** Reconnect QuickBooks manually
   - **Future Fix:** Implement more robust refresh logic with retries

3. **Issue:** PDF export for invoices with 100+ line items may timeout
   - **Workaround:** Limit line items per invoice or generate server-side
   - **Future Fix:** Move PDF generation to Edge Function
