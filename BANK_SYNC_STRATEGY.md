# Bank Syncing & Reconciliation for Batchly

**Inspired by:** Midday's bank sync with GoCardless (EU), Plaid (US/Canada), Teller (US)

**Why This is BRILLIANT for Batchly:**
- Automatically detect customer payments (no waiting for QB sync)
- Match bank deposits to invoices instantly
- See cash flow in real-time
- Reduce reconciliation time from hours to minutes
- Catch payment issues immediately (wrong amounts, missing payments)

---

## TL;DR: This Could Be HUGE for Batchly

**The Problem You're Solving:**
```
Current Flow (Without Bank Sync):
1. Customer pays invoice (check/ACH/credit card)
2. Money hits your bank account
3. You (or accountant) records payment in QuickBooks
4. Batchly syncs payment status from QB (daily at 2 AM)
5. Invoice marked "Paid" in Batchly

‚è±Ô∏è Time lag: 1-2 days from payment to status update
üî¥ Manual work: Recording payment in QB
‚ùå Risk: Payment errors go undetected
```

**New Flow (With Bank Sync):**
```
1. Customer pays invoice
2. Money hits your bank account
3. Batchly detects transaction automatically ‚úÖ
4. AI matches transaction to invoice ‚úÖ
5. Invoice marked "Paid" in Batchly instantly ‚úÖ
6. Optional: Auto-record in QuickBooks ‚úÖ

‚è±Ô∏è Time lag: Real-time (minutes, not days)
‚úÖ Automated: No manual QB entry
‚úÖ Accurate: AI catches mismatches
‚úÖ Visibility: See cash flow live
```

**Value Proposition:**
> "See when customers pay you in real-time, not days later"

---

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

**3-Step Process:**

1. **Connect Your Bank** (one-time setup, 2 min)
   - Click "Connect Bank Account"
   - Select your bank from list
   - Enter bank credentials (secure, read-only)
   - Done! Transactions start syncing

2. **AI Matches Payments to Invoices** (automatic)
   - Bank transaction: "$1,250 from ABC Corp"
   - AI finds: Invoice #INV-0045 for ABC Corp, $1,250
   - Match confidence: 95% ‚Üí Auto-match ‚úÖ
   - Invoice marked "Paid" instantly

3. **Review Exceptions** (only when needed)
   - 70%+ transactions: Auto-matched (no action)
   - 20%: Suggested matches (1-click confirm)
   - 10%: Manual review (unusual transactions)

**Time investment:** 5 min/day ‚Üí 30 min/week ‚Üí 2 hours/month (vs. 4 hours manual reconciliation)

---

## Plaid Integration (Recommended Provider)

**Why Plaid:**
- 12,000+ US banks supported (99% coverage)
- Used by Venmo, Robinhood, Coinbase (trusted)
- Read-only access (cannot move money)
- Bank-level encryption
- Excellent documentation

**Pricing:**
- First 100 accounts: Free (pilot tier)
- After 100: $0.30/month per connected account
- Example: 10 customers = $3/month

**Your pricing model:**
```
Batchly Basic ($25/mo): No bank sync
Batchly Pro ($49/mo): Bank sync included ‚úÖ

Price delta: $24/month
Your cost: $0.30/month
Margin: $23.70/month per customer üí∞
```

## AI Matching Logic (How It Works)

**Matching Factors:**

1. **Amount Match** (50 points)
   - Exact match: 50 points
   - Within 5%: 30 points

2. **Customer Name** (30 points)
   - Fuzzy match on transaction description
   - "ABC Corporation" matches "ABC Corp"
   - "ACH from ABC" matches "ABC Corporation"

3. **Invoice Number** (20 points)
   - Invoice # in transaction description
   - "Payment for INV-0045" matches Invoice #INV-0045

4. **Date Proximity** (10 points)
   - Within 7 days of invoice date: 10 points
   - Within 30 days: 5 points

**Confidence Thresholds:**
```
95-100: Auto-match (notify user)
70-94:  Auto-match (suggest review)
40-69:  Suggest match (require confirmation)
0-39:   No match (manual review)
```

**Example:**
```
Bank Transaction:
  Amount: $1,250.00
  Date: 2025-10-28
  Description: "ACH Credit from ABC Corporation"

Invoice #INV-0045:
  Customer: ABC Corporation
  Amount: $1,250.00
  Date: 2025-10-25

Matching Score:
  Amount: 50 (exact match)
  Customer: 30 (exact name)
  Date: 10 (3 days apart)
  Total: 90 ‚Üí AUTO-MATCH ‚úÖ
```

## When to Build This

### Option 1: NOW (Before Internal Launch)
**Timeline:** 8 weeks total (3 weeks QB sync + 5 weeks bank sync)

**Pros:**
- Launch with killer feature combo
- Huge competitive advantage

**Cons:**
- Delays internal launch by 5 weeks
- More complexity to validate
- Might be overkill for internal use

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Too slow. Validate core first.

---

### Option 2: After Internal Launch (RECOMMENDED)
**Timeline:**
- Weeks 1-3: QB sync + internal launch
- Month 1-3: Validate internally
- Month 4-5: Build bank sync
- Month 6: External launch with bank sync

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Fast internal validation (3 weeks)
- ‚úÖ Learn what matching needs to do
- ‚úÖ Add bank sync as premium feature
- ‚úÖ Differentiate for external launch

**Cons:**
- Internal use without bank sync initially

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ BEST. Core first, then bank sync as "secret weapon" for external launch.

---

### Option 3: After Product-Market Fit
**Timeline:** Month 6-12 (20-50 paying customers)

**Pros:**
- Customer-funded development
- Know exactly what customers need

**Cons:**
- Competitors might add first
- Harder to differentiate later

**Verdict:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Safe but slow. Better to add at external launch.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Customer Hesitation
**Concern:** "I don't want to connect my bank"

**Mitigation:**
- Highlight Plaid trust (Venmo, Robinhood use it)
- Read-only access (cannot move money)
- Optional feature (works without it)
- Show benefits: Real-time payment visibility

---

### Risk: Matching Accuracy
**Concern:** "What if it matches wrong invoice?"

**Mitigation:**
- Conservative threshold (70%+ for auto-match)
- Always notify user of matches
- Audit log (can undo)
- Option for manual confirmation

---

### Risk: Partial Payments
**Concern:** "Customer pays $500 on $1000 invoice"

**Solution:**
- Mark invoice as "Partial" status
- Track multiple payments per invoice
- Show running total: "$500 of $1000 paid"
- Auto-update when remaining $500 received

---

## Real-World Use Case

**Your Daily Workflow (With Bank Sync):**

```
8:00 AM - Check dashboard
  ‚Üí See 3 new payments overnight ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí All auto-matched to invoices ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Customers notified automatically ‚úÖ

8:05 AM - Review exceptions
  ‚Üí 1 transaction needs confirmation
  ‚Üí Click "Confirm Match" (5 seconds)
  ‚Üí Done ‚úÖ

8:10 AM - Process today's orders
  ‚Üí Generate orders from templates
  ‚Üí Approve and invoice
  ‚Üí Continue day

End of day:
  ‚Üí All payments reconciled ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí QB updated automatically ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí Cash flow dashboard current ‚úÖ

Time spent on payment reconciliation: 5 minutes
  (vs. 30 minutes manual QB entry + 4 hours monthly reconciliation)
```
