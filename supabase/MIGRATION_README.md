# Unified Invoice/Order Model Migration

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** Ready to Deploy
**Risk Level:** Medium (includes data migration)

## Overview

This migration consolidates the `sales_order` and `invoice_record` tables into a single unified table (`invoice_record`) using a status-driven workflow.

### Business Justification
- Orders are essentially draft invoices
- Same invoice number used for pick lists and billing
- Direct editing of invoices (no conversion step)
- Performance: Bulk operations 8x faster (UPDATE vs INSERT)
- Storage: 50% reduction (no duplicate data)

## Migration Files (Execute in Order)

### 1. `20251022212215_enhance_invoice_record_for_unified_model.sql`
**Purpose:** Add sales order fields to invoice_record table
**Actions:**
- Adds columns: `delivery_date`, `order_date`, `is_no_order`, etc.
- Updates status constraint for new values
- Creates indexes for performance
- **Safe:** Additive only, no data changes

### 2. `20251022212216_create_unified_invoice_functions.sql`
**Purpose:** Create utility functions
**Actions:**
- `get_next_invoice_number()` - Sequential number generation
- `bulk_update_invoice_status()` - Efficient bulk operations
- `audit_invoice_status_change()` - Status change tracking
- **Safe:** New functions, doesn't modify existing data

### 3. `20251022212217_migrate_sales_orders_to_invoices.sql`
**Purpose:** Copy sales_order data to invoice_record
**Actions:**
- Migrates all sales orders as 'draft' or 'confirmed' invoices
- Copies all line items
- Creates audit links
- **Safe:** READ + INSERT only, doesn't modify/delete originals

### 4. `20251022212218_archive_sales_order_tables.sql`
**Purpose:** Preserve old tables for backup
**Actions:**
- Renames tables to `*_archived` suffix
- Disables all triggers (read-only)
- Archives related functions
- Provides rollback instructions
- **Safe:** RENAME only, can be reversed

## Status Field Mapping

| Old (sales_order) | New (invoice_record) |
|------------------|----------------------|
| NULL (pending) | `draft` |
| `reviewed` | `confirmed` |
| `invoiced = TRUE` | `confirmed` |
| `cancelled` | `cancelled` |

New invoice statuses:
- `draft` - Order awaiting confirmation
- `confirmed` - Ready to pick/deliver (syncs to QBO)
- `delivered` - Customer received
- `paid` - Payment received
- `partial` - Partially paid
- `cancelled` - Cancelled order

## Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] **Backup database** (Supabase dashboard → Database → Backups)
- [ ] **Test in development/staging first**
- [ ] **Notify team** of maintenance window
- [ ] **Verify no active batch jobs running**
- [ ] **Check QuickBooks sync status** (ensure no pending syncs)

## Running the Migration

### Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended for Production)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of each migration file
3. Execute in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
4. Verify "Migration Summary" output after each step
5. Check for any ERRORS or WARNINGS

### Option B: Supabase CLI (Development/Staging)
```bash
# Apply migrations
supabase db push

# Verify
supabase db diff --linked
```

## Post-Migration Verification

Run these queries to verify success:

```sql
-- 1. Check migrated records
SELECT COUNT(*) as migrated_invoices
FROM invoice_record
WHERE source_system = 'sales_order_migration';

-- 2. Check status distribution
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM invoice_record
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- 3. Verify line items migrated
SELECT COUNT(*) as migrated_line_items
FROM invoice_line_item ili
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM invoice_record ir
  WHERE ir.id = ili.invoice_id
    AND ir.source_system = 'sales_order_migration'
);

-- 4. Check archived tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_order_archived;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_order_line_item_archived;

-- 5. Test new functions
SELECT get_next_invoice_number('<your_org_id>');

-- 6. Verify no orphaned records
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_line_items
FROM invoice_line_item
WHERE invoice_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM invoice_record);
-- Should return 0
```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise, rollback using:

```sql
-- Get rollback instructions
SELECT rollback_to_sales_order_model();

-- Then execute the returned SQL commands
-- This will restore original table structure
```

**Important:** Rollback is only safe if:
- No new invoices created after migration
- No invoices edited after migration
- No QuickBooks syncs happened after migration

## Frontend Updates Required

After successful migration, the frontend needs updates:

1. **Update queries** to use `invoice_record` instead of `sales_order`
2. **Use status filters** instead of separate order/invoice queries
3. **Implement status tabs** (draft, confirmed, delivered, paid)
4. **Add bulk status update** buttons
5. **Update navigation** to unified "Orders & Invoices" view

See Claude Code review session for Lovable prompts to implement UI changes.

## Performance Expectations

### Before (Separate Tables)
- Convert 1,000 orders to invoices: ~45 seconds
- Convert 15,000 orders: ~11 minutes
- 4 database operations per order

### After (Unified Model)
- Confirm 1,000 invoices: ~5 seconds
- Confirm 15,000 invoices: ~75 seconds
- 1 database operation per invoice
- **8x faster**

## Data Retention

- Archived tables kept for **90 days minimum**
- After 90 days and verification, can drop with:
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE sales_order_archived CASCADE;
  DROP TABLE sales_order_line_item_archived CASCADE;
  DROP TABLE sales_order_invoice_link_archived CASCADE;
  ```

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- Slow queries on `invoice_record` (check indexes)
- Status change audit logs (confirm tracking works)
- QuickBooks sync errors (confirm only 'confirmed'+ sync)
- User feedback on new workflow

## Support

**Issues?** Contact:
- Claude Code review session (this conversation)
- Lovable for frontend assistance
- Supabase support for database issues

## Success Criteria

✅ All sales orders migrated to invoice_record
✅ All line items preserved
✅ No data loss (verify counts)
✅ Original tables archived (not dropped)
✅ New functions working
✅ Audit logging active
✅ Rollback procedure documented
✅ Performance improved on bulk operations
