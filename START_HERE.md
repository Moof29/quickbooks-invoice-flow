# 🚀 Sales Order → Invoice Unification - START HERE

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Current Branch**: `claude/incomplete-description-011CUPKpNWzk6NttzmisLgty`

---

## 📊 What Happened

You started a migration to unify `sales_order` and `invoice_record` tables into a single unified invoice system.

Lovable began Phase 1 but encountered errors because:
1. The database migration wasn't applied first
2. TypeScript types weren't regenerated
3. The code was trying to use database columns that didn't exist yet

**I've analyzed everything and created a complete plan to fix this properly.**

## 📁 Documents Created

I've created 3 key documents for you:

### 1. **MIGRATION_STATUS.md** 📋
- **What it is**: Detailed analysis of current state
- **Use it to**: Understand what's done vs. what's missing
- **Key info**: Database not migrated yet, frontend 40% done

### 2. **LOVABLE_PROMPTS.md** 🎯
- **What it is**: Step-by-step prompts to give to Lovable
- **Use it to**: Complete the migration in correct order
- **Contains**: Phases 0-8 with exact prompts to copy/paste

### 3. **START_HERE.md** (this file) 📖
- **What it is**: Quick start guide
- **Use it to**: Get oriented and know what to do next

## 🎯 What To Do Next

### OPTION 1: Continue the Migration (Recommended)

**Step 1**: Apply the database migration
- File: `supabase/migrations/20251023000000_unify_sales_order_invoice.sql`
- **Go to**: [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pnqcbnmrfzqihymmzhkb/sql/new)
- **Copy/paste** the entire migration file contents
- **Run it**

**Step 2**: Give Lovable the Phase 0 prompt
- Open: `LOVABLE_PROMPTS.md`
- Copy the **Phase 0** section
- Paste to Lovable
- Wait for completion

**Step 3**: Continue with Phases 1-8
- Work through each phase in order
- Each phase builds on the previous
- Don't skip ahead

### OPTION 2: Rollback Everything

If you want to undo all the migration work and go back to having separate tables:

```bash
git reset --hard 5586047
git push -f origin claude/incomplete-description-011CUPKpNWzk6NttzmisLgty
```

This returns you to the last working state before the unification started.

## 📚 Quick Reference

### Files Changed So Far
- ✅ Migration file created: `supabase/migrations/20251023000000_unify_sales_order_invoice.sql`
- ⚠️ Partially updated (Phase 1):
  - `CreateSalesOrderDialog.tsx`
  - `CreateSalesOrderSheet.tsx`
  - `ModernSalesOrdersList.tsx`
  - `useSalesOrderEdit.tsx`

### Files Still Need Updating
See `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` for complete list.

### Current Issues
1. Database migration not applied
2. TypeScript types not regenerated
3. Some components reference non-existent columns
4. Mixed usage of `sales_order` and `invoice_record`

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

### If you see TypeScript errors:
- This is expected until Phase 0 is complete
- Don't try to fix them manually
- Apply the migration first, then regenerate types

### If Lovable gets confused:
- Show it `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` for context
- Remind it which phase you're on
- Use the exact prompts from `LOVABLE_PROMPTS.md`

### If data gets lost:
- The migration backs up data to `sales_order_archived`
- Original data is preserved
- Migration is designed to be safe

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know the migration is complete when:

- [ ] All TypeScript errors gone
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] Can create new orders (they save as draft invoices)
- [ ] Can view existing orders
- [ ] Can bulk update order status
- [ ] Template generation works
- [ ] Navigation shows "Orders" instead of "Sales Orders"
- [ ] Both `/orders` and `/sales-orders` routes work

## 🎓 What This Migration Does

**Before**:
- Separate `sales_order` table (for orders)
- Separate `invoice_record` table (for invoices)
- Convert sales_order → invoice when ready to bill

**After**:
- Single `invoice_record` table for both
- Status field distinguishes workflow stage:
  - `draft` = what was a pending order
  - `confirmed` = what was a reviewed order
  - `delivered` = shipped but not paid
  - `paid` = completed invoice

**Benefits**:
- Simpler data model
- No conversion step needed
- Unified UI for managing orders and invoices
- Better tracking of order → invoice → payment flow

---

## 🚦 Ready to Start?

1. Read `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` to understand current state
2. Open `LOVABLE_PROMPTS.md` to see all phases
3. Start with **Phase 0** - apply the migration
4. Work through phases sequentially
5. Test thoroughly after each phase

**Good luck!** 🎉
