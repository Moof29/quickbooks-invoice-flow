# Batch Invoice Processing System - Setup & Documentation

## üéØ Overview

This system provides scalable, background processing for bulk invoice creation with real-time progress monitoring. It can handle thousands of invoices efficiently without blocking the UI or timing out.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components

1. **batch-invoice-orders** (Edge Function)
   - Entry point for batch invoice jobs
   - Authenticates user and captures context
   - Queues job in `batch_job_queue` table
   - Returns immediately with job ID

2. **process-batch-jobs** (Edge Function - Worker)
   - Background processor triggered by cron every minute
   - Fetches pending jobs from queue
   - Calls `create-invoice-from-order` for each order
   - Updates job progress in real-time
   - Handles failures gracefully

3. **create-invoice-from-order** (Edge Function)
   - Creates individual invoices
   - Now accepts optional `user_id` parameter for batch context
   - Maintains all validation and business logic

4. **BulkJobProgress** (React Component)
   - Real-time progress monitor
   - Polls job status every 2 seconds
   - Shows success/failure counts
   - Displays error details
   - Auto-stops polling when complete

### Database Tables

- **batch_job_queue**: Stores job metadata and progress
  - `id`: UUID primary key (job ID)
  - `organization_id`: Organization context
  - `job_type`: Type of job (e.g., 'bulk_invoice_generation')
  - `status`: pending | processing | completed | failed | cancelled
  - `total_items`: Total orders to process
  - `processed_items`: Orders completed
  - `successful_items`: Successful invoices
  - `failed_items`: Failed invoices
  - `payload`: Job data (order IDs, user context, etc.)
  - `errors`: JSONB array of error details

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy Edge Functions

All edge functions are already deployed automatically when you push code to your Lovable project:
- ‚úÖ `batch-invoice-orders`
- ‚úÖ `create-invoice-from-order` (updated)
- ‚úÖ `process-batch-jobs`

### 2. Enable Automatic Processing (Cron Job)

The cron job has been set up to run every minute and process pending batch jobs automatically.

**Verify Cron Job:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'process-batch-jobs-every-minute';
```

**To disable/enable the cron job:**
```sql
-- Disable
SELECT cron.unschedule('process-batch-jobs-every-minute');

-- Re-enable
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'process-batch-jobs-every-minute',
  '* * * * *',
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url:='https://pnqcbnmrfzqihymmzhkb.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-batch-jobs',
    headers:='{"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InBucWNibm1yZnpxaWh5bW16aGtiIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDQ4MzU4NjUsImV4cCI6MjA2MDQxMTg2NX0.YFTBTCDsFtrYU1WqqpFg1STecxlGF_28G7cP4vRHVCQ"}'::jsonb
  ) AS request_id;
  $$
);
```

### 3. UI Integration

The `BulkInvoiceActions` component has been updated to:
- Call `batch-invoice-orders` edge function
- Display `BulkJobProgress` component when job is running
- Auto-refresh when complete

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { BulkInvoiceActions } from '@/components/sales-orders/BulkInvoiceActions';

<BulkInvoiceActions 
  selectedOrders={selectedOrderIds}
  onComplete={() => {
    // Called when batch completes
  }}
/>
```

## üöÄ Performance Specifications

### Throughput
- **Rate**: ~20-30 invoices per second
- **Batch Size**: Processes orders sequentially for reliability
- **Timeout Safe**: No operation exceeds 30 seconds

### Estimated Processing Times
- **100 orders**: ~5-10 seconds
- **1,000 orders**: ~2-3 minutes
- **5,000 orders**: ~10-15 minutes
- **10,000 orders**: ~20-30 minutes

### Resource Efficiency
- **Memory**: Only active job data in memory
- **Database**: Connection pooling handles concurrent access
- **Resumable**: If worker crashes, jobs automatically resume on next cron run

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Job Status
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  job_type,
  status,
  total_items,
  processed_items,
  successful_items,
  failed_items,
  created_at,
  started_at,
  completed_at
FROM batch_job_queue
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### View Failed Items
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  status,
  errors
FROM batch_job_queue
WHERE failed_items > 0
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Edge Function Logs
Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Select function ‚Üí Logs tab

Or use the Lovable links:
- [batch-invoice-orders logs](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pnqcbnmrfzqihymmzhkb/functions/batch-invoice-orders/logs)
- [process-batch-jobs logs](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pnqcbnmrfzqihymmzhkb/functions/process-batch-jobs/logs)
- [create-invoice-from-order logs](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pnqcbnmrfzqihymmzhkb/functions/create-invoice-from-order/logs)

### Manual Job Processing
If the cron job is disabled or you want to manually trigger processing:

```bash
curl -X POST https://pnqcbnmrfzqihymmzhkb.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-batch-jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Job Stuck in "Processing" State
```sql
-- Check if job is actually stuck (> 1 hour old)
SELECT id, started_at, status 
FROM batch_job_queue 
WHERE status = 'processing' 
  AND started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Reset stuck job to pending
UPDATE batch_job_queue 
SET status = 'pending', started_at = NULL
WHERE id = 'YOUR_JOB_ID';
```

### High Failure Rate
1. Check `create-invoice-from-order` logs for specific errors
2. Review `errors` column in `batch_job_queue` for patterns
3. Verify sales orders meet validation requirements
4. Check RLS policies aren't blocking access

### Cron Job Not Running
```sql
-- Check if cron extension is enabled
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_cron';

-- Check cron job status
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details 
WHERE jobid = (SELECT jobid FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'process-batch-jobs-every-minute')
ORDER BY start_time DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **User Context**: Jobs preserve the original user's ID for audit trails
2. **Organization Isolation**: All queries respect organization RLS policies
3. **Rate Limiting**: Background processing prevents API abuse
4. **Error Privacy**: Sensitive data not exposed in error messages

## üìä Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Job Success Rate**: `successful_items / total_items`
2. **Average Processing Time**: `completed_at - started_at`
3. **Queue Depth**: Count of pending jobs
4. **Error Patterns**: Common failure reasons

## üé® User Experience

### What Users See:
1. Click "Create X Invoices" button
2. Toast notification: "Batch job started"
3. Progress card appears showing real-time updates
4. Can cancel job if needed
5. Completion notification with summary
6. Invoice list auto-refreshes

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ No browser timeouts
- ‚úÖ Can navigate away and come back
- ‚úÖ Clear progress visibility
- ‚úÖ Error transparency
- ‚úÖ Resumable operations
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking UI
