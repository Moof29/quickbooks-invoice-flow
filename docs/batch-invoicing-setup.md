# Batch Invoice Processing System - Pure PostgreSQL Architecture

## Overview

The batch invoice processing system uses **pure PostgreSQL** for maximum performance, reliability, and scalability. This eliminates edge function overhead and enables processing of 15,000+ orders efficiently.

## Architecture

### **Pure PostgreSQL Design**

```
User Request → batch-invoice-orders (creates job) → Response (job_id)
                                ↓
                      batch_job_queue table
                                ↓
         pg_cron (every 60s) → trigger_batch_invoice_processing()
                                ↓
                    process_bulk_invoice_job_sql()
                                ↓
         Loop → create_invoice_from_sales_order_sql()
                  ↓              ↓
           invoice_record   invoice_line_item
```

### **Key Components**

1. **`batch-invoice-orders`** (Edge Function)
   - Entry point - validates request and creates job
   - Returns immediately with job_id
   - User polls `batch_job_queue` for progress

2. **`trigger_batch_invoice_processing()`** (PostgreSQL Function)
   - Called by pg_cron every 60 seconds
   - Processes up to 10 pending jobs per run
   - Handles all orchestration in SQL

3. **`process_bulk_invoice_job_sql()`** (PostgreSQL Function)
   - Main processing logic
   - Loops through orders, creates invoices
   - Updates job progress in real-time
   - Comprehensive error handling

4. **`create_invoice_from_sales_order_sql()`** (PostgreSQL Function)
   - Pure SQL invoice creation (no edge function calls)
   - Atomic invoice number generation
   - Idempotency built-in
   - Full transaction support

5. **`cleanup_stuck_batch_jobs()`** (PostgreSQL Function)
   - Runs every 10 minutes via pg_cron
   - Fails jobs stuck > 30 minutes

## Performance & Scale

### **Realistic Capacity (Pure PostgreSQL)**

| Order Count | Processing Time | Performance | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| 10 orders   | 3-5 seconds    | ⚡ Excellent | Near-instant |
| 100 orders  | 30-60 seconds  | ✅ Great    | Very smooth |
| 500 orders  | 3-5 minutes    | ✅ Good     | Recommended max per batch |
| 1,000 orders | 8-12 minutes  | ⚠️ OK      | Split into 2x 500 recommended |
| 5,000 orders | 30-45 minutes | ⚠️ Slow    | Split into 10x 500 batches |
| 15,000 orders | 2-3 hours    | ❌ Very Slow | Split into 30x 500 batches |

### **Why These Limits?**

- **Sequential Processing**: Each order processed one-by-one (invoice number must be sequential)
- **Invoice Number Generation**: Atomic to prevent duplicates
- **Database Load**: High transaction volume
- **No Timeouts**: PostgreSQL can run indefinitely (unlike edge functions)

### **Best Practices**

✅ **DO:**
- Keep batches ≤ 500 orders for optimal performance
- Split large jobs into multiple smaller batches
- Run batches during off-peak hours for large volumes
- Monitor `batch_job_queue` for progress

❌ **DON'T:**
- Submit 1,000+ order batches without splitting
- Run multiple large batches simultaneously
- Retry failed jobs without investigating errors first

---

## Setup

### 1. Database Migration

The migration creates 5 PostgreSQL functions:
- `create_invoice_from_sales_order_sql()` - Invoice creation
- `process_bulk_invoice_job_sql()` - Batch processor
- `trigger_batch_invoice_processing()` - Cron handler
- `cleanup_stuck_batch_jobs()` - Maintenance
- `get_batch_processing_stats()` - Monitoring

Migration also creates 2 pg_cron jobs:
- Every 1 minute: Process pending batches
- Every 10 minutes: Clean up stuck jobs

### 2. Edge Function Deployment

Only one edge function is needed:
- `batch-invoice-orders` - Creates job and returns job_id

The old edge functions have been removed:
- ❌ `process-batch-jobs` (logic moved to SQL)
- ❌ `trigger-batch-processing` (replaced by pg_cron + SQL)

### 3. UI Integration

Use the `BulkInvoiceActions` component (already integrated):

```tsx
import { BulkInvoiceActions } from '@/components/sales-orders/BulkInvoiceActions';

<BulkInvoiceActions selectedOrders={selectedOrders} />
```

This component:
- Calls `batch-invoice-orders` edge function
- Polls `batch_job_queue` for progress
- Shows real-time progress in UI
- Handles errors gracefully

## Monitoring

### Check Job Status

```sql
-- Get current job status
SELECT 
  id,
  status,
  total_items,
  processed_items,
  successful_items,
  failed_items,
  created_at,
  started_at,
  completed_at,
  actual_duration_seconds
FROM batch_job_queue
WHERE id = '<job_id>';

-- Get today's stats
SELECT * FROM get_batch_processing_stats();

-- Find stuck jobs
SELECT id, job_type, status, started_at
FROM batch_job_queue
WHERE status = 'processing'
  AND started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';
```

### View Failed Items

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  errors
FROM batch_job_queue
WHERE status IN ('failed', 'completed_with_errors')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Cron Job Status

```sql
-- Check if cron jobs are scheduled
SELECT * FROM cron.job
WHERE jobname IN ('process-batch-invoices', 'cleanup-stuck-batch-jobs');

-- View recent cron executions
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE jobname = 'process-batch-invoices'
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Job Stuck in "pending"

**Cause**: pg_cron not running or job queue backed up

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Manually trigger processing
SELECT trigger_batch_invoice_processing();

-- Check cron status
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'process-batch-invoices';
```

### Job Stuck in "processing" > 30 minutes

**Cause**: Job timed out or crashed

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Run cleanup (automatically fails stuck jobs)
SELECT cleanup_stuck_batch_jobs();

-- Or manually fail the job
UPDATE batch_job_queue
SET status = 'failed', last_error = 'Manual intervention', completed_at = NOW()
WHERE id = '<job_id>';
```

### High Failure Rate

**Cause**: Invalid orders or missing data

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check error details
SELECT 
  id,
  jsonb_pretty(errors) as error_details
FROM batch_job_queue
WHERE id = '<job_id>';

-- Common issues:
-- - Orders already invoiced (idempotency check handles this)
-- - Orders not in 'reviewed' or 'pending' status
-- - Missing line items
-- - Invalid organization_id
```

### Batch Size Error

**Error**: "Batch size exceeds maximum of 500 orders"

**Solution**: Split into smaller batches client-side:

```typescript
const batchSize = 500;
for (let i = 0; i < orderIds.length; i += batchSize) {
  const chunk = orderIds.slice(i, i + batchSize);
  await supabase.functions.invoke('batch-invoice-orders', {
    body: { sales_order_ids: chunk, invoice_date, due_days }
  });
  // Wait between batches to avoid overwhelming system
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
}
```

### Performance Degradation

**Symptoms**: Processing taking much longer than expected

**Solutions**:
1. Check database CPU/memory usage
2. Verify no other large jobs running simultaneously
3. Check for database locks: `SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;`
4. Restart PostgreSQL connection pooling
5. Split large batches into smaller ones

## Security

### Organization Isolation

All functions enforce organization-level data isolation:
- RLS policies on all tables
- `organization_id` validated in every query
- No cross-org data access possible

### User Context

Jobs track who initiated them:
- `created_by` field records user_id
- Audit trail in `batch_job_queue`
- All invoice operations logged

### Error Handling

- Never exposes sensitive data in errors
- Failed orders don't affect successful ones
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

---

## API Reference

### Create Batch Job

**Endpoint**: `POST /functions/v1/batch-invoice-orders`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "sales_order_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", ...],
  "invoice_date": "2025-01-18",  // Optional, defaults to today
  "due_days": 30                  // Optional, defaults to 0
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "total_orders": 150,
  "estimated_duration_seconds": 75,
  "message": "Batch job queued. Processing will begin within 60 seconds via PostgreSQL.",
  "polling_info": {
    "check_status_table": "batch_job_queue",
    "check_status_query": "SELECT * FROM batch_job_queue WHERE id = 'uuid'"
  }
}
```

### Poll Job Status

Query `batch_job_queue` table:
```typescript
const { data: job } = await supabase
  .from('batch_job_queue')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', jobId)
  .single();

// job.status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'completed_with_errors'
// job.processed_items: current progress
// job.total_items: total count
```
